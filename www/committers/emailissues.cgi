          Problems can occur when subscribers to our email lists report messages as SPAM.
          These may be genuine SPAM (though this is rare on most of our lists), or it may
          just that the subscriber has forgotten that they signed up to receive the emails.
          If enough customers of an email provider report our emails as SPAM, then the ASF domain may
          be blocked by the provider.
        }
        _p %{
          Once they become aware of such issues, our Infrastructure team will attempt to get
          the ban lifted, but that may take a while, and they may not be successful.
        }
        _p %{
          If you are using one of the problem domains and are having difficulty subscribing,
          or emails are not getting through, try using a different provider for
          communications with the ASF.

        The Infrastructure team have been trying to get the bans removed,

        servers are being rejected; i.e. on average 50% of mails will not be delivered.
