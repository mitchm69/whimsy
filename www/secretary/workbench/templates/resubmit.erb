Dear <%= @email.display_names.join(', ') %>,

Thanks for the ICLA, however we already have a copy.
If you are not already a committer, the <%= @cttee %> can use the existing ICLA to request your account by using Whimsy:

https://whimsy.apache.org/officers/acreq.cgi (PMC chair and ASF members only)

If you are already a committer on another project, the <%= @cttee %> can use Whimsy to give you permissions to the repository:

https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee

Please take up any further queries with the <%= @cttee %>.

Warm Regards,

<%= @sig %>
