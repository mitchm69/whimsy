This directory is mainly for files used by Wunderbar.

These are the Wunderbar files:
bootstrap-min.css
bootstrap-min.js
bootstrap-theme-min.css
jquery-min.js
stupidtable.min.js
underscore-min.js
vue.min.js

The versions of the above files must agree with the ones included with Wunderbar.
If not, Wunderbar will try to install the file locally; this will probably fail.

The following files are not currently used by Wunderbar:
bootstrap-select.css
bootstrap-select.js

They can be updated as necessary.
